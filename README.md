# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LucaLeonx

I'm a curious Computer Science Student, currently based in Milan, Italy, but with the dream to travel the world.
Now what I'm looking for is challenging internships and meaningful open-source projects to work in.
If you have any proposal or want only to chat with me it's possible to reach me here on on my [linkedin]()
