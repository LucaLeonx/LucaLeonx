# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LucaLeonx

I'm a curious computer science student based in Milan, Italy, but I dream of traveling the world.
Now what I'm looking for is challenging internships and meaningful open-source projects to work on.
If you have any proposals or want only to chat with me it's possible to reach me here on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaleonzio/))
